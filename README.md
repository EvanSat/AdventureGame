# The Great Developer Adventure

We will create a game that takes us through the journey of becoming a developer and finding your place in the business world.

The story will start with finding your to development with hobbies and choices before the college experience, working your way throught free time activities and class choices in college, lasty finding your way in the world and seeing if you success as a CEO in a start up or rethink your life choices in the development world.

With the project utilizing Python our goal is to create a mobile friendly application to test your skills and knowledge. Our timeline is mapped out below for weekly goals and we plan on having chats at least once a week while we are configuting the application.

# Running Tests

Once you've got the necessary dependencies, you can run the tests by using `pytest` in the root directory.

These tests will automatically run when pushing up a new branch to GitHub.

The `main` branch is protected. Any new changes must be pushed up as a new branch, then approved  by at least one other person on the team, with passing tests.

# Creating Your Own Adventures

Use this application as a foundation for introducing students to Python!

You can build your own adventures or add to the existing storyline by editing 
the files in [stories](./stories).
